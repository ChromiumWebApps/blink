// How the DatabaseContext Life-Cycle works?
// ========================================
// ... in other words, who's keeping the DatabaseContext alive and how long does
// it need to stay alive?
//
// The DatabaseContext is referenced from RefPtrs in:
// 1. ExecutionContext
// 2. Database
//
// At Birth:
// ========
// We create a DatabaseContext only when there is a need i.e. the script tries to
// open a Database via DatabaseManager::openDatabase().
//
// The DatabaseContext constructor will call ref(). This lets DatabaseContext keep itself alive.
// Note that paired deref() is called from contextDestroyed().
//
// Once a DatabaseContext is associated with a ExecutionContext, it will
// live until after the ExecutionContext destructs. This is true even if
// we don't succeed in opening any Databases for that context. When we do
// succeed in opening Databases for this ExecutionContext, the Database
// will re-use the same DatabaseContext.
//
// At Shutdown:
// ===========
// During shutdown, the DatabaseContext needs to:
// 1. "outlive" the ExecutionContext.
//    - This is needed because the DatabaseContext needs to remove itself from the
//      ExecutionContext's ActiveDOMObject list and ContextLifecycleObserver
//      list. This removal needs to be executed on the script's thread. Hence, we
//      rely on the ExecutionContext's shutdown process to call
//      stop() and contextDestroyed() to give us a chance to clean these up from
//      the script thread.
//
// 2. "outlive" the Databases.
//    - This is because they may make use of the DatabaseContext to execute a close
//      task and shutdown in an orderly manner. When the Databases are destructed,
//      they will deref the DatabaseContext from the DatabaseThread.
//
// During shutdown, the ExecutionContext is shutting down on the script thread
// while the Databases are shutting down on the DatabaseThread. Hence, there can be
// a race condition as to whether the ExecutionContext or the Databases
// destruct first.
//
// The RefPtrs in the Databases and ExecutionContext will ensure that the
// DatabaseContext will outlive both regardless of which of the 2 destructs first.
