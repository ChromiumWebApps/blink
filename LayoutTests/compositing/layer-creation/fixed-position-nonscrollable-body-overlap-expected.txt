Even though we can opt-out of fixed-position compositing for unscrollable fixed-position containers, we still need to composite fixed-position layers that need compositing for other reasons such as overlap.

(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 4024.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 4024.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (children 2
        (GraphicsLayer
          (position 10.00 100.00)
          (bounds 100.00 100.00)
          (contentsOpaque 1)
          (drawsContent 1)
          (backgroundColor #FF0000)
        )
