Test that layers can be nicely added or removed from a squashed layer, without unnecessary repaints on any layer. Click anywhere to test interactively; keep clicking to proceed through the test.

CASE 1, original layer tree with overlap1 and overlap2:
(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 600.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 600.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (children 1
        (GraphicsLayer
          (children 2
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 60.00 60.00)
              (bounds 400.00 400.00)
              (contentsOpaque 1)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (backgroundColor #808080)
            )
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 140.00 140.00)
              (bounds 180.00 180.00)
              (drawsContent 1)
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
CASE 2, overlap3 gets added:
(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 600.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 600.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (repaint rects
        (rect 300.00 300.00 100.00 100.00)
      )
      (children 1
        (GraphicsLayer
          (children 2
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 60.00 60.00)
              (bounds 400.00 400.00)
              (contentsOpaque 1)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (backgroundColor #808080)
            )
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 140.00 140.00)
              (bounds 260.00 260.00)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (repaint rects
                (rect 0.00 0.00 100.00 100.00)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
CASE 3, overlap2 gets removed. Since this does not resize the layer, there should only be a repaint of overlap2:
(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 600.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 600.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (children 1
        (GraphicsLayer
          (children 2
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 60.00 60.00)
              (bounds 400.00 400.00)
              (contentsOpaque 1)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (backgroundColor #808080)
            )
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 140.00 140.00)
              (bounds 260.00 260.00)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (repaint rects
                (rect 80.00 80.00 100.00 100.00)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
CASE 4, overlap1 gets removed:
(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 600.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 600.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (children 1
        (GraphicsLayer
          (children 2
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 60.00 60.00)
              (bounds 400.00 400.00)
              (contentsOpaque 1)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (backgroundColor #808080)
            )
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 300.00 300.00)
              (bounds 100.00 100.00)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (repaint rects
                (rect 0.00 0.00 100.00 100.00)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
CASE 5, overlap2 gets added back:
(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 600.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 600.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (repaint rects
        (rect 220.00 220.00 100.00 100.00)
      )
      (children 1
        (GraphicsLayer
          (children 2
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 60.00 60.00)
              (bounds 400.00 400.00)
              (contentsOpaque 1)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (backgroundColor #808080)
            )
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 220.00 220.00)
              (bounds 180.00 180.00)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (repaint rects
                (rect 0.00 0.00 100.00 100.00)
                (rect 0.00 0.00 100.00 100.00)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
CASE 6, overlap1 gets added back, and overlap3 gets removed:
(GraphicsLayer
  (bounds 800.00 600.00)
  (children 1
    (GraphicsLayer
      (bounds 800.00 600.00)
      (contentsOpaque 1)
      (drawsContent 1)
      (repaint rects
        (rect 140.00 140.00 100.00 100.00)
      )
      (children 1
        (GraphicsLayer
          (children 2
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 60.00 60.00)
              (bounds 400.00 400.00)
              (contentsOpaque 1)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (backgroundColor #808080)
            )
            (GraphicsLayer
              (position 140.00 140.00)
              (bounds 180.00 180.00)
              (drawsContent 1)
              (repaint rects

                (rect 0.00 0.00 100.00 100.00)
              )
            )
          )
        )
